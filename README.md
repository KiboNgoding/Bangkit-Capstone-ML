In this project, the machine learning team collects data such as MSME data and User data. MSME data is collected in detail based on the Bank Indonesia website which MSMEs are eligible for financing after being entered into the application such as product type, location, category, and others. Not only that, the machine learning team takes user data with the aim of knowing user preferences such as goods or services that are often used. After that, the machine learning team cleans the data such as removing dots, outliers and commas so that later if the data is trained, it can be run. The machine learning team chose the machine learning model, Recommendations.
The Machine Learning algorithm used is Matrix Factorization where in this context, the simple model bases its recommendations on matrix operations to find users' preferences for umkm products and categories.
The conclusion is that this system uses a simple matrix-based approach to provide users with key product recommendations based on their preferences for umkm categories. The use of TensorFlow here is for matrix operations and calculations required to create the recommendation system. After model selection, the model will be trained using the processed data to create a recommendation system that can predict users based on MSME preferences and profiles.
